Pbs:
----

- Synchronization of the two boards:
* Don t care and communicate asyncronously 
* Use IR (but crowding and reliability pbs)

- Reliability of IR for datastreaming:
* Send few discrete commands
* work hard on IR protocol (see also crowding)

- IR crowding: 
* If both boards send IR signals, possible ambiguity at the receiver side
* If a board both send and receive, how to distinguis self and non
self message.  

- Define good features from raw data:
* AAAA
* "good" filters and tresholds
* geometric models

Possible use:
-------------

- IR command:
* define various light patterns
* trigger patterns associated to IR remote commands

- Local rate control:
* get the accel amplitude averaged over axes (AAAA)
* define light patterns based on AAAA range or PWM based on AAAA

Environment control:
--------------------  

- Control of music/sound (engine noise modulated by rotation speed)
- Control lightning
- Capture tragectories

photodiode


Things to do:
-------------

Define protocol IR
Use flextimer2
calibrate accel
